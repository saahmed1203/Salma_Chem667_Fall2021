## Description

These are the scripts that were used to create the final two GUI scripts (for detecting objects in images and video)

#### Key

- _mouse (in the script name)_ = there is a GUI (if not in title, the script relies on keystrokes)
- _keyboard_SA.py_ = has functions for each keystroke and is imported to the scripts that rely on the keyboard
- _test (in the script name)_ = was used to create a certain function that was later copied to the larger scripts
